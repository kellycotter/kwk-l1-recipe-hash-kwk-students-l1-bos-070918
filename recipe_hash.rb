perfect_10_recipe = {
  :almond_flour => "2 cups", 
  :gluten_freewhole_oats => "1 cup",
  :kosher_salt => ".5 teaspoon",
  :baking_powder => ".5 teaspoon",
  :baking_soda => ".25 teaspoon",
  :xanthan_gum => ".5 teaspoon",
  :sliverd_almonds_lightly_toasted => ".25 cup",
  :mini_dark_chocolate_chips => ".75 cup",
  :olive_oil_ => ".5 cups",
  :agve => ".25 cups",
}



#1. Create a hash called `perfect_10_recipe` that has the following data:
#  - almond flour - 2 cups
#  - gluten freewhole oats - 1 cup
#  - kosher salt - 1/2 tea spoon
#  - baking powder  - 1/2 tea spoon
#  - baking soda - 1/4 tea spoon
#  - Xanthan Gum - 1/2 tea spoon
#  - slivered almonds, lightly toasted - 1/4 cup
#  - mini dark chocolate chips - 3/4 cup
#  - olive oil - 1/2 cup
#  - agave - 1/4 cup
# All of the ingredients should be symbols and the amounts should be strings. Remember that symbols start with a colon and be sure to sub underscores for spaces.

#2. Write a method that simply returns (not puts) your perfect_10 hash


  perfect_10_recipe.each do |ingredients, amount|
    puts "Ingredient: #{ingredients}"
    puts "Amount: #{amount}"
  end
  
  
  


#2: Write code that returns the amount of chocolate chips from perfect_10 ingredients that is needed in the recipe.

def amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe = :mini_dark_chocolate_chips)
  perfect_10_recipe.each do |ingredient, amount|
    puts "ingredients: #{ingredient[7]}"
    puts "amount: #{amount[7]}"
end
end

amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)



#3: Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.
def ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
end

#4: Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use the `each_key` method.
def ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
end

#5: Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use the `each_value` method.
def amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
end

#6: Return the number of ingredients in the `perfect_10_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
end
